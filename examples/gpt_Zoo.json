  "hair_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not have hair covering their bodies. In zoology, this usually includes groups like birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and many invertebrates such as insects and worms. [INDICATOR] Not having hair often indicates that the animal does not belong to the mammal group, with a few rare exceptions like some nearly hairless mammals. It can also indicate different ways of keeping body temperature, such as using scales, feathers, moist skin, or water around the body instead of a hair coat. [PATTERN] This value is common in animals that live in water or very wet environments, such as fish and many amphibians. It is also typical in animals with scales, shells, or exoskeletons, like snakes, lizards, and crabs. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “has hair” value because these animals lack a fur or hair covering for insulation or sensing. They usually rely on other structures, such as scales or feathers, or their environment to protect and regulate their bodies instead of hair.",
  "hair_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have hair or fur on at least part of their bodies. In zoology, this is a defining trait of mammals, such as cats, dogs, horses, and humans. [INDICATOR] Having hair indicates that the animal is almost always a mammal and likely produces milk for its young. Hair can help with temperature control, camouflage, touch sensing, and communication. [PATTERN] This value is common in land mammals, but also appears in marine mammals such as seals and sea otters that still keep some fur. Some mammals may have less visible hair, such as whales which have small hairs around the mouth or in early life stages. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not have hair” value by clearly pointing toward membership in the mammal group. Animals with hair mostly use internal temperature control and rely on their fur or hair as insulation, unlike hairless animals that use other structures or behaviors.",
  "feathers_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not have feathers on their bodies. Most mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates are in this group. [INDICATOR] Not having feathers indicates that the animal is not a bird and does not use feathers for flight, insulation, or display. Instead, these animals rely on skin, hair, scales, shells, or other coverings. [PATTERN] This value is typical for animals that live in water, underground, or on land without needing feathered wings, such as frogs, snakes, wolves, and sharks. It is also common in flying animals that use different structures, such as bats that fly with skin wings rather than feathers. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “has feathers” value because featherless animals do not share the same special body covering that is unique to birds. They tend to have different flight methods or do not fly at all and use other structures for warmth and protection.",
  "feathers_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have feathers covering their bodies. Feathers are a key feature of birds, such as sparrows, eagles, penguins, and ostriches. [INDICATOR] Having feathers indicates that the animal is a bird and often capable of flight, although some birds like ostriches and penguins do not fly. Feathers serve many roles, including flight, insulation, waterproofing, and visual displays for mating or warning. [PATTERN] This value is found in animals that hatch from eggs and have beaks, such as chickens, ducks, and parrots. Feathers can vary in shape and color depending on habitat and lifestyle, for example water birds with dense waterproof feathers or tropical birds with bright display feathers. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not have feathers” value by pointing directly to birds rather than mammals, reptiles, or other groups. Animals with feathers usually have very different body plans and life histories from those with hair, scales, or bare skin.",
  "eggs_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not normally lay eggs as part of their main reproductive method. Most placental mammals, such as dogs, cows, and humans, belong to this group because they give birth to live young. [INDICATOR] Not laying eggs indicates that the developing young grow inside the parent's body until birth. It often suggests longer parental care inside the body and sometimes more advanced development at birth. [PATTERN] This value is common in many land mammals and some marine mammals, such as whales and dolphins. These animals invest heavily in gestation and often produce fewer offspring at a time compared with egg layers. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “lays eggs” value because the main reproductive strategy is live birth rather than external eggs. Animals in this group usually have different reproductive organs and care strategies than egg-laying birds, reptiles, and fish.",
  "eggs_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that lay eggs as part of their normal reproduction. Birds, most reptiles, amphibians, fish, many insects, and a few mammals such as the platypus lay eggs. [INDICATOR] Laying eggs indicates that part or all of the early development happens outside the mother's body. Eggs may be protected in nests, buried in soil or sand, attached to plants, or simply released into water. [PATTERN] This value is common in animals that produce many offspring at one time, such as frogs and many fish that release huge numbers of eggs into water. It is also seen in birds and reptiles that lay fewer eggs but provide more protection, such as hens, sea turtles, and penguins. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not lay eggs” value because it points to external egg-based development instead of live birth. Egg-laying animals often have different breeding seasons, nesting behaviors, and parental care patterns than live-bearing mammals.",
  "milk_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not produce milk to feed their young. Most non-mammal animals, such as birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates, are in this group. [INDICATOR] Not producing milk indicates that the young are fed in other ways, for example by yolk inside the egg, by hunting food on their own soon after birth, or by being fed regurgitated food like many birds do. It also indicates that the adult does not have mammary glands. [PATTERN] This value is typical in species where young are born or hatch with enough ability to move and feed quickly, such as baby chicks that peck for food or baby turtles that crawl to the sea. It is also found in animals with very short or no direct feeding care from parents. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “produces milk” value because it does not point to mammalian style nursing. Species in this group use different feeding strategies and do not have the close nursing behavior seen in mammals.",
  "milk_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that produce milk to feed their young. This is a defining trait of mammals, such as cows, cats, whales, and humans. [INDICATOR] Producing milk indicates the presence of mammary glands and close physical contact between parent and offspring during nursing. It also suggests a period of dependence in which the young rely on the mother's milk before they can eat solid food. [PATTERN] This value is common in a wide range of mammals, from small rodents to large whales, and occurs in both land and marine environments. In many cases, milk production supports fewer, more cared-for offspring with higher survival chances. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not produce milk” value by clearly marking the mammal group. It indicates a specific type of parental care and internal temperature control that is not found in birds, reptiles, or fish.",
  "airborne_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that are not able to fly or glide through the air in a sustained way. Most mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and many insects are in this category. [INDICATOR] Being non airborne indicates that the animal depends on walking, running, climbing, swimming, or crawling for movement rather than flight. Their bodies are not shaped for powered flight, and they usually lack wings or similar structures. [PATTERN] This value is typical for large land animals like elephants, lions, and crocodiles, and also for many small animals such as frogs and worms. Some animals may make short hops or leaps, but they do not stay in the air for long periods. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “airborne” value because these animals cannot fly, hover, or glide effectively. They rely on ground or water movement and usually have heavier bodies or limb structures that are not suited to aerial life.",
  "airborne_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that can move through the air by flying or gliding. It includes most birds, many insects like butterflies and bees, and some mammals such as bats. [INDICATOR] Being airborne indicates the presence of wings or wing-like structures and muscles adapted for flight or gliding. It often suggests light body weight, special bones, and other adaptations such as strong chest muscles. [PATTERN] This value is common in animals that search for food, escape predators, or migrate long distances using flight, such as swallows, geese, and dragonflies. Some airborne animals glide from tree to tree rather than fully powered flying, like flying squirrels or some lizards. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “not airborne” value because these animals use the air as a main movement space. They usually have very different body shapes, behaviors, and senses adapted to three dimensional movement.",
  "aquatic_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not live mainly in water. They may visit water to drink or bathe, but they spend most of their lives on land or in the air. [INDICATOR] Being non aquatic indicates that the animal's body and behavior are adapted for land, trees, or air rather than for swimming or living underwater. They usually breathe air directly and may struggle or drown if kept underwater too long. [PATTERN] This value is common in land mammals like dogs and horses, many reptiles like snakes and lizards, and most birds that nest on land. Some species may be able to swim briefly, like cats or deer, but they are not true water dwelling animals. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “aquatic” value because these animals do not rely on water as their primary habitat. Their limbs, skin, and senses are better suited to dry surfaces instead of constant immersion.",
  "aquatic_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that live mainly in water for most or all of their lives. It includes many fish, marine mammals like dolphins, and aquatic invertebrates like octopuses and jellyfish. [INDICATOR] Being aquatic indicates that the animal's body is shaped and adapted for swimming, such as having fins, flippers, streamlined shapes, or gills. It also suggests that many life functions, such as feeding and breeding, occur in water. [PATTERN] This value is common in oceans, rivers, and lakes, where animals like sharks, carp, and seals feed and reproduce. Some aquatic animals, like frogs or crocodiles, split time between water and land but still rely heavily on water environments. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “not aquatic” value because water is the main living space, not just a resource. Aquatic animals have body coverings, breathing systems, and movement styles that work best in water and not on dry land.",
  "predator_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that are not primarily hunters of other animals. They may feed on plants, dead animals, or very small organisms, or they may be opportunistic feeders. [INDICATOR] Being non predator indicates diets such as herbivory, scavenging, or filter feeding rather than active hunting of large prey. These animals often have flatter teeth for grinding plants or special structures for sifting food rather than sharp claws and fangs. [PATTERN] This value is common in many grazing mammals like cows and deer, plant eating insects like caterpillars, and filter feeders like many small crustaceans. Some may still eat tiny animals but do not chase and kill large prey. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “is a predator” value because these animals do not rely on active hunting as their main feeding method. They often have different body shapes, teeth, and behaviors focused on plants, detritus, or microscopic food.",
  "predator_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that actively hunt, capture, and kill other animals for food. Classic predators include lions, wolves, eagles, sharks, and many spiders. [INDICATOR] Being a predator indicates sharp teeth or beaks, strong jaws, claws or other catching tools, and senses tuned to detect prey such as keen vision or smell. It also suggests behaviors such as stalking, chasing, ambushing, or using traps like webs or venom. [PATTERN] This value is found in many habitats, from forests and grasslands to oceans, with predators occupying roles at or near the top of food chains. Some predators hunt alone, like leopards, while others hunt in groups, like wolves or orcas. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “not a predator” value because predators depend on killing and eating other animals as their main food source. Their bodies and behaviors are shaped for attack and capture, unlike plant eaters or scavengers.",
  "toothed_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not have true teeth. They may have beaks, keratin plates, or other mouth parts instead of separate tooth structures. [INDICATOR] Not having teeth indicates that the animal feeds in ways that do not require biting or chewing with hard tooth surfaces. For example, birds use beaks to peck or tear, and some fish and invertebrates suck or filter their food. [PATTERN] This value is common in birds like ducks and pigeons, and in animals like turtles that have hard beaks. It also appears in some species that filter small particles from water, such as certain whales with baleen plates, though those plates are not true teeth. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “has teeth” value because these animals lack separate, rooted tooth structures for grinding or cutting. Their feeding methods and mouth shapes are adapted to tearing, pecking, filtering, or swallowing food in large pieces.",
  "toothed_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have teeth in their jaws. Teeth may be shaped for cutting, tearing, gripping, or grinding, and they are found in most mammals, many reptiles, and many fish. [INDICATOR] Having teeth indicates the ability to bite and process food inside the mouth. Tooth shape can suggest diet, such as sharp fangs in carnivores like tigers or flat molars in plant eaters like horses. [PATTERN] This value is common across many groups, including dogs, crocodiles, sharks, and many rodents. Teeth often grow and wear down over time and may show distinct patterns for species and age. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not have teeth” value because toothed animals use chewing or biting as a main part of feeding. They usually do not rely solely on beaks, filtering plates, or pure suction when eating.",
  "backbone_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not have a backbone or spinal column. These animals are called invertebrates and include insects, worms, mollusks, and many marine species such as jellyfish and sea stars. [INDICATOR] Lacking a backbone indicates that the animal's body is supported by other structures, such as an outer shell, an exoskeleton, or soft tissues. Their nervous system and internal organs are arranged differently from animals with a spine. [PATTERN] This value is common in very small animals and many ocean dwelling species, such as crabs, octopuses, and corals. It is also typical in land invertebrates like spiders and snails that may have hard outer coverings instead of bones inside. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “has backbone” value because these animals belong to a very broad group that does not share the rigid internal spine of fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals. Their movement and protection strategies rely on different body plans.",
  "backbone_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have a backbone, also called a vertebral column. These animals are vertebrates and include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. [INDICATOR] Having a backbone indicates a central support structure for the body and a protected spinal cord. It usually goes along with an internal skeleton made of bone or cartilage that supports muscles and organs. [PATTERN] This value is found in many familiar animals such as dogs, frogs, snakes, eagles, and salmon. Vertebrates tend to be larger on average than many invertebrates and often show more complex movement patterns. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not have backbone” value because it marks membership in a specific group with a shared internal skeletal structure. These animals have different body organization and growth patterns compared to invertebrates like insects or worms.",
  "breathes_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not breathe air directly from the atmosphere using lungs or similar organs. Instead, they may absorb oxygen from water through gills or through their skin. [INDICATOR] Not breathing air indicates that the animal is adapted to obtain oxygen while submerged or in very moist environments. Many fish and some aquatic invertebrates belong to this group and will die if they are kept out of water for too long. [PATTERN] This value is common in fully aquatic species such as many bony fish and some larval forms of amphibians, like tadpoles. It can also apply to tiny animals that exchange gases directly through their skin or body surface without air breathing organs. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “breathes air” value because these animals do not come to the surface to inhale. Their bodies are built to take up oxygen from water or moist surroundings rather than from open air.",
  "breathes_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that breathe air from the atmosphere. They use lungs or lung like structures to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. [INDICATOR] Breathing air indicates that the animal must have access to the surface or to pockets of air, even if it spends much time in water, like whales and dolphins. It often suggests adaptations such as nostrils, lungs, and chest muscles built for inhaling and exhaling. [PATTERN] This value is common in mammals, birds, reptiles, and adult amphibians such as frogs. Some aquatic animals, like sea turtles and seals, also breathe air and must surface regularly despite living in water. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not breathe air” value because these animals depend on air filled spaces rather than dissolved oxygen in water. Their survival and activity patterns are often tied to how often they must reach air to breathe.",
  "venomous_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not produce venom for use in biting, stinging, or other active delivery to another animal. They may still defend themselves with teeth, claws, or other means, but not with injected toxins. [INDICATOR] Being non venomous indicates that the animal's bite or sting does not contain special glands for venom injection. Any harm caused is due to physical damage rather than toxic effects. [PATTERN] This value is common in many mammals, most birds, most fish, and many reptiles that do not rely on venom, such as pythons. It is also widespread among harmless insects that may still pinch or bite but without venom, like many beetles. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “venomous” value because these animals do not use chemical toxins delivered through fangs, stingers, or spines as a primary weapon or hunting tool. If they are dangerous, it is usually through size, strength, or physical injury instead of venom.",
  "venomous_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that produce venom and actively deliver it through bites, stings, or specialized spines. Examples include cobras, rattlesnakes, many spiders, scorpions, and some fish like lionfish. [INDICATOR] Being venomous indicates the presence of venom glands and delivery structures such as hollow fangs, stingers, or barbed spines. Venom is used to subdue prey, start digestion, or defend against threats. [PATTERN] This value is found in many small predators that rely on venom to overcome larger or struggling prey, such as certain spiders and wasps. It is also common in animals that need strong defense, like some sea snakes and cone snails. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “not venomous” value by the use of toxins that are injected into other animals. Venomous animals can pose a special risk even without great size or strength because their chemical weapons can quickly disable or kill.",
  "fins_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not have fins on their bodies. Their limbs, if present, are legs, wings, or other structures instead of flat, webbed, or ray supported fins. [INDICATOR] Not having fins indicates that the animal is not a typical fish and does not rely on fin based swimming for movement. These animals may still swim using limbs or body undulation, but without true fins. [PATTERN] This value is common in land animals like dogs and lizards, and in birds that may swim using webbed feet or wings, such as ducks and penguins. It also appears in some aquatic animals, like sea snakes, that move without distinct fins. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “has fins” value because these animals lack the specialized paired and unpaired fin structures seen in many fish. Their movement in water, if it occurs, is achieved through other body parts or body waves.",
  "fins_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have fins, which are flat or ray supported structures used mainly for swimming. Most fish and some aquatic animals like rays and certain marine mammals with fin like flippers are in this group. [INDICATOR] Having fins indicates that the animal's body is adapted for efficient movement in water. Fins help with steering, balance, braking, and forward motion. [PATTERN] This value is common in bony fish such as salmon and carp, and in cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays. Some animals have modified limbs that act like fins or flippers, such as dolphins and seals, which use them in a similar way. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not have fins” value by the presence of specialized swimming surfaces that extend from the body. Finned animals usually show streamlined shapes and rely on water as a main habitat.",
  "legs_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have no legs. They move by slithering, swimming, crawling with the whole body, or drifting. [INDICATOR] Having zero legs indicates that the animal relies on body waves, muscular contractions, or currents rather than separate limbs for movement. Snakes, many fish, eels, worms, and some aquatic invertebrates are in this group. [PATTERN] This value is common in animals that live in water, underground, or in tight spaces where legs would get in the way, such as earthworms or burrowing snakes. It also appears in plankton and jellyfish that drift or pulse without legs. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from values with two or more legs because these animals lack jointed walking appendages. Their body shape and movement patterns are very different from legged animals that step or climb.",
  "legs_2": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have two legs. The two legs are usually used for walking or hopping while the front limbs may form wings or arms. [INDICATOR] Having two legs often indicates upright or semi upright movement, such as walking on the hind limbs. Humans, many birds like chickens and ostriches, and kangaroos are examples. [PATTERN] This value is common in birds, which use their two legs for ground movement and wings for flight. It also appears in some mammals that move mostly on their hind limbs, such as humans and kangaroos. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from other leg counts, such as four or six legs, by indicating a body plan that separates front and rear limbs for different roles. Two legged animals often have special balance and spine structures to support upright posture.",
  "legs_4": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have four legs. Most land mammals such as dogs, cats, cows, and horses are in this group, as are many reptiles like lizards. [INDICATOR] Having four legs indicates a body plan built for walking or running on all fours. It often suggests good stability and the ability to move quickly over land. [PATTERN] This value is common in grazing animals, land predators, and many medium to large reptiles. Many four legged animals can also swim well, using their legs as paddles, such as otters and crocodiles. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from two legged values, which show upright movement, and from six or eight legged values, which are usually arthropods. Four legged animals almost always belong to the vertebrate group, especially mammals and reptiles.",
  "legs_5": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have five main leg like appendages used for movement. This is unusual in classic land vertebrates but appears in some invertebrates when counting their main walking arms. [INDICATOR] Having five legs suggests a radial or irregular body plan rather than the typical two sided shape. For example, a sea star has five arms that function in movement similar to multiple legs, even though they are not true legs like those of a dog. [PATTERN] This value is mainly seen in certain sea animals such as many sea stars that have five radiating arms used to crawl along the sea floor. It might also represent rare deformities or injuries in normally six or more legged animals that now use five. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from more common leg counts like four or six, which match standard body plans in vertebrates and insects. Five legged body layouts are rare and often point to unusual or radial body structures rather than typical leg pairs.",
  "legs_6": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have six legs. This is a key feature of insects such as ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and butterflies. [INDICATOR] Having six legs indicates membership in the insect group, with three pairs of legs attached to a three part body of head, thorax, and abdomen. The legs are used for walking, jumping, grasping, or swimming depending on the species. [PATTERN] This value is common in land and air dwelling arthropods, including many plant feeding and predatory insects. Some six legged insects also have wings, such as flies and wasps, which give them both walking and flying ability. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from four legged vertebrates and eight legged arachnids by marking the typical insect body plan. Six legs strongly separate insects from spiders, crabs, and mammals in classification.",
  "legs_8": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have eight legs. It is typical of arachnids such as spiders, scorpions, and many mites. [INDICATOR] Having eight legs indicates a body plan with four pairs of jointed legs usually attached to a combined head and body region. These animals are often predators or scavengers and use their legs for walking, sensing, and sometimes holding prey. [PATTERN] This value is common in land species such as house spiders and scorpions, and also in some marine animals like certain sea spiders. Many of these animals have simple eyes and rely heavily on their legs and silk or venom for survival. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from six legged insects and four legged vertebrates by clearly pointing to the arachnid group. Eight legs help separate spiders and their relatives from other arthropods like insects and crustaceans.",
  "tail_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that do not have a distinct tail extending from the rear of the body. Their backside may end bluntly or with only small structures. [INDICATOR] Not having a tail indicates that the animal does not use a long rear appendage for balance, communication, or swimming. Humans, some frogs, and many insects appear tailless in their adult form. [PATTERN] This value is common in animals that rely more on body shape and limbs for movement and signaling, such as apes that have no external tail. It is also found in animals that lose the tail during development, like tadpoles turning into adult frogs. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “has tail” value because tailless animals lack a long rear extension that can be moved or waved. They use other body parts or postures for balance and display instead of a tail.",
  "tail_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have a tail extending from the rear of the body. The tail can be long or short, furry, scaled, or bare, depending on the species. [INDICATOR] Having a tail indicates that the animal may use it for balance, movement, communication, fat storage, or defense. For example, cats use their tails for balance, kangaroos for support and hopping, and some lizards can detach their tails to escape predators. [PATTERN] This value is common in many mammals, reptiles, and some birds, such as monkeys, dogs, crocodiles, and peacocks. In aquatic animals like many fish, the tail and tail fin are main sources of propulsion. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “does not have tail” value because these animals possess an obvious, movable rear appendage. The presence of a tail can strongly influence their movement style and social signals.",
  "domestic_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that are not domesticated and live mainly in the wild. They have not been bred over many generations to live closely with humans. [INDICATOR] Being non domestic indicates that the species keeps its natural behaviors, diet, and breeding without strong human control. Examples include wolves, tigers, wild deer, and most birds and reptiles found in natural habitats. [PATTERN] This value is common in animals that live in forests, deserts, oceans, and other natural environments with little direct human care. Some species can still adapt to cities, like wild pigeons or rats, but they are not truly domesticated. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “domestic animal” value because these animals have not been shaped by selective breeding for traits useful or friendly to humans. They are usually less predictable as pets and may be more dangerous or difficult to manage.",
  "domestic_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that have been domesticated by humans. They have been bred over many generations to live with people and to show traits that humans find useful or manageable. [INDICATOR] Being domestic indicates that the animal depends partly or fully on humans for food, shelter, or breeding. Examples include dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, pigs, and many breeds of chickens. [PATTERN] This value is common in species kept on farms for meat, milk, eggs, or wool, as well as in pets kept for companionship. Domestic animals often show reduced fear of humans and may have body shapes or colors that differ from their wild ancestors. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “not domestic” value because domesticated animals have a long history of living with humans and being bred for certain traits. They are usually easier to handle, feed, and breed under human control than their wild relatives.",
  "catsize_0": "[CORE] This value describes animals that are not about the size of a typical house cat. They may be much smaller, like mice, or much larger, like cows or elephants. [INDICATOR] Not being cat sized indicates that the animal's body weight and length fall outside the moderate small size range around that of a domestic cat. This can strongly affect how the animal moves, what it eats, and where it can live. [PATTERN] This value is common in very small animals such as insects, frogs, and songbirds, and in large animals such as horses, lions, and bears. Many animals at the extremes of size have special adaptations, such as flight in tiny birds or great strength in large mammals. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “cat sized” value by pointing to animals whose size does not fit near that middle small range. It helps separate very small or very large species from those that are roughly similar in scale to a domestic cat.",
  "catsize_1": "[CORE] This value describes animals that are roughly the size of a typical house cat, both in weight and body length. This includes small mammals like rabbits, some small dog breeds, and many wild carnivores such as small foxes. [INDICATOR] Being cat sized indicates a compact body that is small enough to be easily carried by a human but large enough to hunt small prey or eat a varied diet. These animals often share similar space needs and can live in modest sized shelters or territories. [PATTERN] This value is common in small predators and omnivores, such as ferrets and some mongooses, as well as in many pet animals. Many cat sized animals are agile and able to jump, climb, or hide easily in vegetation or human buildings. [DISTINCTION] This value differs from the “not cat sized” value because it marks a middle size range that is useful for comparing pets, small wild mammals, and similar species. It separates them from tiny creatures like mice and from large animals like deer or cattle."
